1 - Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even;

2 - The GameControl Componenet should have buttons to start and stop the game;

3 - When Starting the game, an event (holding a incrementing number) should get emitted each second (ref = setInterval())

4 - The event should be listenable from outside the component

5 - When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted (clearInterval(ref))

6 - A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted, the same should happen for the Even Component (on even numbers)

7 Simply output Odd - Number or Even - NUMBER in the two components

8 Style the element (e.g. paragraph) holding your output text diferently in both components
